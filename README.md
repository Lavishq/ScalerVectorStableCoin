# Vector USD aka VUSD
## VUSD is Backed by other StableCoins such as USDC , USDT, DAI, BUSD, Frax and more.

## Creation of VUSD
Deposite the collateral Tokens(USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, Frax) and Mint VUSD

## Burning of VUSD
Burn VUSD and get back the collateral Tokens(USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, Frax)

## Why we Need VSDC
Diversification: By backing the VUSD with multiple stablecoins, the risk is spread across various assets, reducing the potential for any one asset to cause a significant impact on the overall value of the stablecoin.
